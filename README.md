# LIAISE website tracker

The aim of this project is to have a simple way to receive notifications when the LIAISE website changes, in order not to miss any new information.

I run a daily cron job that mirrors the LIAISE website and commits any new changes to this same git repository.

Using the GitHub feature that allows to follow a repository, I receive e-mail notifications when new changes have been detected.
