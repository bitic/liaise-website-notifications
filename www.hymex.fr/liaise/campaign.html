<font face="arial">
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
This is the last field campaign of the HyMeX project, and is a core
activity leading into HyMeX phase 2. The study domain
for LIAISE is the Ebro basin in northeastern Spain, which is bound to
the north by the Pyrenees and to the south by the Iberian
System. Surface heterogeneity has grown due to the presence of human
society, which has been altering the hydrological cycle and the
landscape mainly through intense agricultural activity. There are 2
observation periods :
</p>
</font>

<font face="arial" size="+1">
<b>1) Intensive Observation Period (IOP): April through September 2021</b></font><br><br>


<font face="arial">
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
A network of surface energy budget (SEB) observing stations will be
installed within an approximately 10 km radius centered over the
Urgell and Pl&agrave; d&apos;Urgell (Lleida) region of the Ebro basin. This area
is selected since it encompasses multiple representative Mediterranean
land cover types, including a small lake. This location will also allow us to benefit from the
dense local meteorological station and radar data from the Spanish
State Meteorological Agency (AEMET) and the Meteorological Service of
Catalonia (SMC), along with an existing extensive observation site run
by the Institute of Agrifood Research and Technology (IRTA), which
includes weighing lysimeters. This network will
enable us to evaluate the ability of land surface models (LSMs) to simulate fluxes,
especially evapotranspiration, over irrigated sites and to contrast
the fluxes with those from natural surfaces. These sites will be
maintained at least through entire growing season. State-of-the-art
soil moisture products [such as that from the Soil Moisture and Ocean
Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions] will
be combined with in situ soil moisture observations from an existing
network in collaboration with the Ebro Observatory and private
irrigation-monitoring companies for use in assimilation into the LSMs
and/or for evaluation. Field-scale actual and potential
evapotranspiration will be evaluated using two-source energy balance
(TSEB) models, which combine thermal observations from Sentinel-3
satellites and optical observations from Sentinel-2 satellites.
</p>
</font>

<font face="arial" size="+1">
<b>2) Special Observation Period (SOP): July, 2021 </b></font><br><br>

<font face="arial">
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The SOP is planned for July, when contrasts between
irrigated and natural surfaces are at their maximum.
The SEB stations will be complimented by additional biogeophysical
measurements and trublence estimates,
such as those from scintillometers. The SEB network
will be complemented by extensive measurements of the lowest 4 km of
the atmosphere using captive balloons, frequent radio-sounding
releases, UHF wind profilers, lidars and approximately five flights by the
French Office of Aircraft Instrumented for Environmental Research
(<a href="https://www.safire.fr/fr/">SAFIRE</a>)/ATR42 aircraft. Measured atmospheric fluxes and state
variables will be used in conjunction with fully coupled,
non-hydrostatic mesoscale models to study the impact of irrigation on
the spatial variability of the ABL, the basin scale circulation and
water budget and interactions between the irrigated and natural
surfaces. In addition, high-resolution land surface temperature,
solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) and
surface soil moisture estimates will be aquired from instruments
onboard the ATR42.

<p>The main study (corresponding to the field campaign)
within the Ebro basin is indicated in the image from Google maps
  below. The base of operations for the campain will be at IRTA in
  Mollerussa.
  The focal point of the campaign is the transition
  between irrigated and rainfed areas NW and SE of the

Update from G. Canut-Rocafort (CNRM).

<p>
A large amount of equipment was first deployed
at <a href="images/la_cendrosa_crane.jpg">La Cendrosa: the initial
    arrival of the team from CNRM</a>.
  The <a href="images/cendrosa_50mtower.png">50m mast</a> from CNRM
  has been mounted on the La Cendrosa super site. Following the experience during the
<a href="https://www.umr-cnrm.fr/spip.php?article1086" target=_blank>SOFOG3D</a> campaign,
the mast has been modified and the ground anchoring
consolidated with a strong involvement of the STAR team (CNRM).
In order to document the atmospheric boundary layer during the SOP
period, in addition to surface-atmosphere interactions, hourly
radiosondes and tethered balloon flights will be carried out at this
site. To increase our observations in terms of wind and turbulence the
LISA team of CNRM/GMEI will complete the device.
Finally, the Parsivel2 disdrometer from Grenoble has been installed
by the U. Barcelona near the 50m mast.

This is a rain-fed site located in an area with natural grasses and
winter cereal crops dominating the landscape. In July, the vegetation
is generally dry (or harvested), and there are also considerable
baresoil surfaces. The baseline instrumental setup resembles that of
La Cendrosa (in the irrigated zone) in order to be able to contrast
these two sites through the surface layer and into the ABL: a 50m flux
tower (the same as that for La Cendrosa), UHF, and soil moisture and
temperature. Additional instruments will also be installed for the
SOP. This site is being mainly run by the UKMO. The UHF is provided by
the Laboratoire d'Aerologie (LA).
A lidar will be installed near this site, pointing northward with a
swath across
the transition zone between the irrigated and rain-fed zones (provided
by LMD).
Finally, a similar frequent radio-sounding release strategy is also
planned for the SOP.
More specific details will be provided soon once the insallation is complete.

<p>
Two meteorological stations have recently been installed at Ivars lake
by the 4M team from CNRM. The goal is to provide screen-level
meteorological measurements during the LOP over the land 
adjacent to the lake at two locations which are localted on opposite
side of the lake in proximity to the scintillometers (which are to be
deployed by WUR for the SOP). The
<a href="images/catamaran.jpg" target=_blank>floating EC station</a> has been
successfully installed by CNRM
which will give flux measurements over the lake to be
compared with thoise derived from scintillometry. In additon, there
are lake water temperature measurements at depths of 5, 10, 30, 50, 100,

Update from D. Mart&iacute;nez-Villagrasa (UIB).


<p>
The Mollerussa site of LIAISE is located at the IRTA experimental
facility, south-west of the town, and contains two weighing lysimeters
over an apple orchard. This agricultural plot is drip irrigated with
the tree rows oriented approximately along a north-south line. The
University of the Balearic Islands (UIB) is responsible for mounting a
surface energy balance (SEB) station over the western weighing
lysimeter.
</p>

<p>
During the days of 24-26 March 2021, the first installation phase was
conducted. An UIB team (Bel&eacute;n Mart&iacute; and Daniel Mart&iacute;nez-Villagrasa)
set up the 6-m tower with the aid of the IRTA staff and installed the
soil kit part of the station. Two sets of soil sensors were deployed
approximately 20 cm to the west and 40 cm to the east of the
irrigation line, each consisting in temperature measurements at 1.5, 5
and 8 cm deep from the surface and a heat flux plate (HFP01,
Hukseflux) and a water content reflectometer (CS650, Campbell Sci.) at
8 cm. In addition, the western set contains temperature measurements
at 17 and 23 cm, together with a heat flux plate and a water content
reflectometer at the deeper level. The objective of these measurements
are to monitor the upper soil characteristics of the tree row. These
sensors are currently running and the data can be monitored
remotely. The aerial part of the station is planned to be installed at
the beginning of May.

  <b>Irrigated Vineyard</b>
</font>
<br>
<font face="arial">
Update from M. Le Page (CESBIO)


<p>A <a href="images/vineyard.png">surface energy balance system</a>
  has been installed over a vineyard
  near the town of Verd&ugrave; within the framework of the ESA WineEO
  project
  and the HILIAISE-ANR project. F. Granouillac and B. Lemaire (CESBIO)
  installed the vineyard experiment between 30/03/21 and 31/02/21.
</p>  

<p>
The objective of this experiment is to provide fluxes, vegetation and
soil moisture measurements for use in an improved version of the FAO56 model
for rank tree crops (ESA WineEO project). It will also
complement the LOP flux
measurements over the Urgell region for the LIAISE project (by adding
fluxes for another unique land cover type).
The vineyard is approximately 25 years old, which was originally not
irrigated: drip irrigation was installed only three years ago. The row
spacing is 4 meters. The vine canopy is guided vertically at a
height of about 2 meters. There is no vegetation cover on the
inter-row. The soil is very shallow (about 50 cm) and stony. The
monitoring system is composed of a Campbell-Scientific IRGASON (H2O
and C fluxes), an Apogee 4 bands net radiometer, three soil heat flux
plates, two SKYE NDVI sensors, three DeltaT ML2x soil moisture sensors
(5, 20 and 40 cm) on the row and one surface soil moisture sensor on
the inter-row. Three weather variables are also monitored: rainfall,
temperature and relative humidity. The experiment will be completed by
mid April with an optical camera for vegetation porosity and IRT
Cameras. This system will hopefully  be maintained in place until the harvest
in September. The experiment, will be supported by a weekly field
survey of soil moisture and vegetation porosity.
A webpage has been setup at CESBIO by P. Fanise for the

  <b>Soil Moisture Network</b>
</font>
<br>
<font face="arial">
Update from M. Le Page (CESBIO)

<p>
 A network of soil moisture sensors has been installed over different
 crops at Prat de Bold&ugrave;.
 The installation is carried on in the framework of the ESA
 <a href="https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/irrigation-expro/" target=_blank>Irrigation+</a>
 project and the HILIAISE-ANR project.
P. Fanise, M. Le Page (CESBIO) installed the soil moisture network
between 30/03/21 and 01/04/21, together with D. Tous de Moner of SAF-Sampling.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this experiment is multi-purpose: 1st, to test an innovative low-cost
network designed at
<a href="https://www.cesbio.cnrs.fr/" target=_blank>CESBIO</a>,
2nd, to provide validation data for the
estimation of soil moisture by the GLORI remote sensing instrument, the Sentinel-1 algorithm
(as a part of HILIAISE), and 3rd, to improve the CESBIO algorithm of irrigation
retrieval (ESA Irrigation+ project).
In agreement with the Cooperative of Ivars, a network of 2 gateways
and 14 soil moisture stations has been installed at 
Prat de Bold&ugrace; between March 30, and April 1st 2021. The site is
characterized by cereal crops (barley, wheat, maize), vegetables (peas,
broccoli), fodders (alfalfa) and apple trees. The irrigation methods
are gravitary irrigation, sprinkler irrigation (pivot, ramp and full
cover) and drip irrigation on broccoli.
The monitoring system has been designed and implemented at
CESBIO. Each node is connected to a gateway by a LoRA module. Some
tests on the area showed that the transmission can reach up to 3.5
kilometers if there is no topographic obstacle. The gateway is in
charge of receiving and storing all the data from the nodes and to
transmit to a server over the phone network. The gateway has a
capacity of 16 Gb which allows a very long term storage.
After several benchmarks, we have selected a low-cost Chinese sensor
which has proven to provide steady and trustworthy measurements.
Before installation, each sensor was
calibrated against a DeltaT ML2X sensor.

A node installed on peas (left): The logger is attached to a bamboo
stick, which has the advantage to be cut in place at the right
height (50 cm). A small flag helps to identify the node. The two
sensors are introduced at a depth of 5 cm and 20 cm (CESBIO, SAF Sampling).

An <a href="images/seb_boldu.jpg">EC station from  Hohenheim University 
is now running since May 29th on a newly planted maize field </a>
